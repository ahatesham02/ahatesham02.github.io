Hi, I'm Ahatesham Bhuiyan, currently a Lecturer in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [City University](https://www.cityuniversity.edu.bd/), Dhaka, Bangladesh. I completed my B.Sc. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (ETE) from [Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET)](https://www.cuet.ac.bd/) in 2023. I am passionate about attention mechanisms, large language models, computer vision, and multimodal learning.

My research focuses on natural language processing and computer vision, with publications in international journals such as Heliyon, where I worked on enhancing image caption generation using a context-aware attention mechanism. I have also submitted a paper on a text-enhanced multimodal fusion network for disaster response, demonstrating my ongoing commitment to research and innovation.

Feel free to explore my research and projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ahatesham02) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahatesham-bhuiyan-4b5927169/)!
