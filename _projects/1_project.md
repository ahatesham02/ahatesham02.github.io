Improving Image Captioning Via Context Aware Attention Network

- A novel approach is proposed to link semantic representation in Bangla text with visual information where a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture is used.

- Context-aware attention mechanism is employed for accurate object diagnosis in Bangla image captioning.

- ResNet-50 is used for encoding image features and bidirectional GRU architecture is utilized to generate accurate captions.
